# AMQP

You can use these credentials to authenticate the following nodes with AMQP.
- [AMQP Sender](../../nodes-library/nodes/AMQPSender/README.md)
- [AMQP Trigger](../../nodes-library/trigger-nodes/AMQPTrigger/README.md)

## Prerequisites

You need to have a AMQP 1.0 compatible message broker installed.

## Using ActiveMQ connection

Use your Hostname, Port, User, and Password as the AMQP Sender credential data in n8n.

**Note:** The default username for ActiveMQ is `admin` and the default password is `admin`.
