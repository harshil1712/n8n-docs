## FAQ

::: faq How to read the data in the format they were entered in Google Sheets?

By default, the unformatted values are read. For example, if your sheets have a column which contains dates (2020-09-24) the node will read them as numbers, perform the mathematical operation (subtraction for this example), and will give you the output (output for the example of the date: 1987).

If you want the formatted values, click on ***Add Option*** and select 'Formatted Value'. This will return the values as they are. For example, the dates will be returned in the format they were entered (2020-09-24).

If you want to return the formula used in the cells, click on ***Add Option*** and select 'Formula'.
:::

::: faq How to append an array in the Google Sheets?

To insert the data in Google Sheets, you have to first convert the data in a valid JSON (key, value) format. You can use the [Funtion node](../../core-nodes/Function/README.md) to convert the array into JSON format.
:::

::: faq How to return all the values with the Lookup operation?

By default, the Lookup operation returns only the first value that it matches. To return all the values that match, click on ***Add Option*** and select 'Return All Matches'. Toggle ***Return All Matches*** to true.
