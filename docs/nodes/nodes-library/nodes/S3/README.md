# S3

S3 is an object storage service that allows you to block public access to all of your objects at the bucket or the account level with S3 Block Public Access. S3 maintains compliance programs, such as PCI-DSS, HIPAA/HITECH, FedRAMP, EU Data Protection Directive, and FISMA, to help you meet regulatory requirements.

## Example Usage

This workflow allows you to upload a file to a S3 compatible server. You can also find the [workflow](https://n8n.io/workflows/592) on n8n.io. This example usage workflow would use the following nodes.
- [Start](../../core-nodes/Start/README.md)
- [Read Binary File](../../core-nodes/ReadBinaryFile/README.md)
- [S3]()

The final workflow should look like the following image.
