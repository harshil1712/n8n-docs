## Share your story üíå

n8n users come from a wide range of backgrounds, experience levels, and interests. We have been looking to highlight different users and their projects in our [blog posts](https://medium.com/n8n-io/tagged/interview). If you‚Äôre working with n8n and would like to inspire the community, email Tanay at tanay@n8n.io to tell your story üíå


## Help out the community ü§ù

You can participate in the [forum](https://community.n8n.io/) and help the community members out with their questions.

When sharing workflows in the community forum for debugging, use code blocks. Use triple backticks (```) to wrap the workflow JSON in a code block.

The following video demonstrates the steps of sharing workflows on the community forum.

## Contribute a workflow üß¨

You can publish workflows on [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/workflows) to help other users to get started.

To share a workflow, follow these steps.

1. Sign in to [n8n.io](https://n8n.io/login).
2. Open the [workflows](https://n8n.io/workflows) page.
3. Click on the ***+ Share New Workflow*** button.
4. Enter the name of your workflow in the ***Name*** field. The name of a workflow makes it easy for others to understand the purpose of the workflow.
5. Enter a detailed description of the workflow in the ***Description*** field. Make sure the description contains information about the nodes used in the workflow.
6. Add a screenshot of the workflow in the description.
7. In n8n, select all the nodes in your workflow (Ctrl + A) and copy them (Ctrl + C).
8. Delete the existing code in the ***Workflow Code*** field and paste your workflow in it (Ctrl + V).
9. Click on the ***Publish Workflow to Share*** button to share your workflow.

The following video demonstrates the steps mentioned above.

## Contribute to the docs üìö

You can contribute to the documentation. The repository for the docs exists [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs). You can find guidelines for the contributions to the docs [here](https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-docs/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md).


## Write a blogpost ‚úçÔ∏è

We have the following process for guest contributions to our [Medium publication](https://medium.com/n8n-io):
1. Guest authors submit a pitch regarding the use-case and the workflow they want to write about in the form of an outline. Email Tanay at tanay@n8n.io to get started.
2. If the use-case and workflow seem interesting for our audience, we'll give you a green light to submit the piece.
3. After you submit the piece, one of our team members would start a first edit (we usually do this in Google docs), where they'll try running through the article to check if everything is clear and easy to follow.
4. Once all the questions or comments are resolved, we'll do a final review before publishing the article on our Medium publication.

Depending on the length of the article and the changes that might be required, there would be a bit of a back and forth and the whole process might take somewhere between a couple of days to a week or two.
